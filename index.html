            When asked to write a webpage about anything, a webpage that most probably no one will ever read, why not write about yourself?
            Writing is an increadibly therapeutical activity, that involves not only the rational side of the brain. In the process of writing,
            subconcious thoughts may arise from the deep end of the mind, back to the surface, where we can aknowledge them and act on it.<br><br>
            Thus, I decided to write about myself. Thinking about the main subjects in my life, I came to realize that there are three fundamental
            pillars that make up my life. The first and main pillar is Social life, mainly my closest fifteen friends and family members. The second
            pillar are my Books, as reading takes up an important proportion of my day. The last pillar is Economics, as I dedicate great part of
            my thoughts to micro and macroeconomic explanations to human behavior, and I am lucky to have chosen it as my career.<br><br>
