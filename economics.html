            One of the crucial decisions many teenagers have to make is what to study and where. I was always sure I would study Engeneering, as it was
            what everybody told me, as well as what I told myself. But in my last years of high school, I found myself immersed in Economics, a science
            that proved to be the perfect combination of Mathematics and Social Sciences.<br><br>
            I have been studying Economics at Universidad Torcuato di Tella for the last two years and I cannot imagine myself anywhere else. I was fortunate
            enough to decide what was right for me more than two years ago and my interest does not stop growing.<br><br>

                  How billions of people agree on the exchange of goods with no intrinsec value, such as money, for goods totally necessary for substenance, as food.

                <div class="col-sm">
                  How phenomena as inflation and economic growth can occurr with or without government intervention, as well as the literature that supports each ideology.
