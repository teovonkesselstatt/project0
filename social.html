                Spending time with the people you love is probably the most gratifying experience anyone can have. I have been part of many friend groups
                through my life, and I can assure, without a doubt, that the people that I decided to have and keep on my surroundings are the best people
                I have ever known. As they say, friends are the family that you get to choose, and I have chosen wisely.<br><br>
                My activities with them include wakeboarding in the Tigre rivers, partying Fridays and/or Saturdays, having the casual argentine "asado",
                playing football, or just hanging out. They influence my personality in the most positive way imaginable, always pulling me out of my
                comfort zone to discover new boundaries. They are, for the most part, really intelligent and profound, which invites me to look upto and
                reach them on those aspects.<br>
                <br>
                Regarding my family, over the years I am proud to affirm that they have became friends that I chose. Many people, actually most people,
                are "stuck" with families they don't entirely fit into. But this is far from being my case, as I am grateful for having inherited and learned
                their values, as well as spending my days and sharing experiences with them.<br>
