Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project, I decided to create a webpage about myself and my hobbies.
index.html contains the introduction to my page, displaying the links to the other html pages.
social.html contains a few images of my friends and family, as well as a text in that subject.
books.html contains an unordered list of the things I most appreciate about a book, followed by a table of the most influential books I have read.
Finally, eco.html displays three buttons where the user can choose to press in order to determine (very vaguely) their economic positioning, followed by a text in the matter and a grid displaying the three things I find most amusing in economics.
All of the html pages are interconnected, and all images are in the folder 'images'.
